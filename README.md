Project: Rock Paper Scissors ( The Odin Project Assignment )

Problem Solving time: 
1. Understand 2. Plan 3. Divide

- The player will select a choice.
- The computer will select a choice as well. (fixed selection in an array)
- The choices will be compared. if - else stuff.
- A winner will be decided. "You win! / You lose!" on playing one round 
- Playing a game will compare the points and decide the winner.



What I actually learned: 
- How to randomly select items out of an array 
- I can fit all 3 tie situations into just one if 
- I can group all wins and all loses situations using || to make the code easier to read.
- I can't return during a for loop, yay.

A basic rock paper scissors has been created. 



Things I can do in the future: 
- Create an error message if player inputs something wrong (completed)
- Complete the game on the web
- Assign a "how many times you want to play" to the game() function
- Create a "play again" option
